# Task 6 – Password Strength Analysis

## 📌 Objective
To evaluate and compare the strength of multiple passwords using **The Password Meter**, and understand how different character combinations affect password security.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **The Password Meter** (https://passwordmeter.com) – For testing password strength.
- **Web Browser** – To access the tool.
- **Kali Linux / Windows** – OS environment for testing.

---

## 📝 Steps Performed

### **Step 1 – Open The Password Meter**
- Access the website [https://passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com) in your browser.

### **Step 2 – Enter Passwords for Testing**
- Input different passwords to check their **Score** and **Complexity**.
- Observe **Additions** (strength factors) and **Deductions** (weaknesses).

### **Step 3 – Record Results**
- Four different passwords were tested:
  
| **Password**            | **Score** | **Complexity** | **Remarks** |
|-------------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| `bharatnama`            | 10%       | Very Weak      | Only lowercase letters, lacks numbers & symbols |
| `Bharat123`             | 68%       | Strong         | Uppercase + lowercase + numbers, but no symbol |
| `Bharat@2005`           | 100%      | Very Strong    | Uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbol |
| `MyDogRuns@5AM12025`    | 100%      | Very Strong    | Long, complex, multiple uppercase/lowercase/numbers/symbols |

### 1️⃣ Weak Password – `bharatnama`

### 2️⃣ Strong Password – `Bharat123`

### 3️⃣ Very Strong Password – `Bharat@2005`

### 4️⃣ Very Strong & Long Password – `MyDogRuns@5AM12025`

---

## 📊 Analysis
- Password strength increases with **length**, **variety of characters**, and **use of symbols**.
- Avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns.
- A **passphrase** with mixed characters can be both strong and easy to remember.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The experiment shows that:
- Simple lowercase passwords are **very weak** and easy to crack.
- Adding **uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols** significantly improves strength.
- Long passphrases with mixed content provide **maximum security**.
